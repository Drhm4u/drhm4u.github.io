## Interactive map with Bokeh

**Project description:** I took a dataset from Kaggle. 
This dataset provides a comprehensive record of missing migrants and their tragic journeys towards international destinations. The datas are collected since 2014 by the Missing Migrants Project, an initiative implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). 

My idea was to create a comprehensive map in which we can see : 
- The areas where tragic events happen.
- The cause of death for each event happened.

Note : The datas included go from 2014 until 2022. 

### Interactive Bokeh map
For this DataViz exercise, a few data cleaning have been done to obtain this result :

<img src="images/causes of death.PNG?raw=true"/>
#### Conclusion
Through this map, we can isolate the different causes of death. 
We can see in which part of the world those tragic events take place.
We can also note the differences of those tragic events between the regions of the world. 

Some conclusions can be drawn studying this map : 
- Drowning takes place in the mediterranean sea for the most part this cause of death

- The border between the USA and Mexico is subjected to Violence.

- Same note for the border between Syria and turkey

-  Before migrants can reach the sea, they face sickness (interestingly it happens to travelers that reach Libya)
