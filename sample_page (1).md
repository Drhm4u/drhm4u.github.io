## Who will open a term-deposit ?

**Project description:** The main idea of the project is to get insights on who is likely to open a term-deposit (depending on people's situations) and which behaviour we should adopt to easier the process of making people accept the term-deposit proposal. 


### Insights

Here are the insights of what datas highlighted in our analysis :

- Terms deposits are more likely to be done by young and old people.

- Life's already organized when married compared to single : less opening when married than when single.

- Being contacted by phone is a better way to conclude a term deposit than another one.

- There's more chances to conclude to a term deposit with the more well paid people then others.

- Personal loans influences the rate of default (Default people are unlikely to open a term-deposit compared to others).

- There is nothing that indicates from housing loan that people will be likely to be in default.

- It's a good thing to contact again the potential customers to follow-up those who were reached.

- It's a good thing to let people think before contacting them again.
  + The chances for an opening of a term-deposit is even better when the potential client was contacted before the campaign.

- The client has already developed a trustworthy relationship with the bank before the campaign.
  + The client is more aware of the advantages that bank may offer before getting hooked by a campaign.
